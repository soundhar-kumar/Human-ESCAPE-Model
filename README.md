## 📘 Overview

This research introduces a **novel threat modeling framework** that shifts cybersecurity focus from systems to people. Traditional threat models like STRIDE and PASTA emphasize code-level flaws and system weaknesses. However, this paper argues that **modern attackers increasingly exploit human trust, biases, and procedural gaps**, not just technical vulnerabilities.

To address this, we present the **Human-E.S.C.A.P.E. Threat Model** – a structured approach for analyzing and defending against human-centric cyber attacks.

## 🧩 Abstract

> This paper argues that enterprise security must shift from technical-centric models to human-centric approaches, as attackers increasingly bypass strong technical defenses through psychological manipulation. Through case studies of major breaches at **Twitter (2020), Uber (2022), and MGM Resorts (2023)**, the paper introduces the **Human-E.S.C.A.P.E. Threat Model**—a six-stage framework to help organizations identify and mitigate social engineering-based attack vectors.

## 📚 What This Research Changes

| 🧠 From | ✅ To |
|--------|------|
| Traditional security modeling focused on servers, code, and network protocols | Human-centered modeling that accounts for cognitive bias, authority misuse, and procedural gaps |
| Viewing employees as “weak links” | Recognizing them as critical components of the defense system |
| Underestimating help desk security | Identifying it as a **high-value attack surface** |
| MFA as a foolproof defense | Demonstrating how **MFA can be socially engineered** and bypassed |

## 🔍 The Human-E.S.C.A.P.E. Model

A new model introduced in the paper, E.S.C.A.P.E. breaks down social engineering attacks into six dimensions:

1. **Entry Vector** – Initial contact method (e.g., phishing, vishing)
2. **Social Tactic** – Psychological technique used (e.g., pretexting, urgency)
3. **Cognitive Bias** – Bias being exploited (e.g., authority, likability)
4. **Authority Abuse** – Role/process being impersonated
5. **Procedural Gap** – Broken/missing verification steps
6. **Evasion of Controls** – How technical defenses were neutralized

## 🔬 Case Studies Analyzed

- **Twitter Breach (2020)**: Attackers vished employees to bypass MFA and hijacked accounts
- **Uber Breach (2022)**: MFA fatigue exploited through WhatsApp + dark web credentials
- **MGM Resorts (2023)**: A single vishing call to help desk triggered a $100M ransomware incident

---

## 📌 Why This Is Useful

- ✔ Helps **CISOs and security architects** model non-technical threats
- ✔ Offers **real-world analysis** instead of theoretical models
- ✔ Provides **actionable mitigation** for IT help desks and MFA workflows
- ✔ Can be integrated with existing frameworks like NIST and ISO

This paper introduces the Human-E.S.C.A.P.E. model to address rising human-centric cyber threats. Analyzing breaches at Twitter \[8], Uber \[10], and MGM Resorts \[15], it shows how social engineering exploits trust and procedural gaps to bypass MFA and IAM, demanding a shift in threat modeling focus.
